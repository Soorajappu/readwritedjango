                        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin
                        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
                        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
                        and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.
                        This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
